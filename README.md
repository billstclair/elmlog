 Elm code for maintaining a LispLog-like weblog.

 Reads and writes RSS, as xml or json.

 See [lisplog.org](https://lisplog.org) for lisp implementation of this. The new one adds Markdown as the default content type, but supports HTML, as now. and writes HTML, to make browsing FAST.
 
 To debug:
 
     cd .../elmlog
     elm reactor
